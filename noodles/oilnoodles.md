## Noodles
- 100g noodles
- 2 heads of Chinese cabbage (Pak choi)
- 3 tbsp oil
- 1 tbsp gochugaru
- 4 cloves of garlic
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp black rice vinegar
- 2 tbsp green onions
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp white pepper

## To Finish
- Chili garlic sauce or chili oil, for topping (see [homemade recipe here](https://thefoodietakesflight.com/how-to-make-homemade-chili-oil/))
- More chopped green onion or scallion
- Doubanjiang or chili broad bean paste
- More soy sauce or chinkiang vinegar

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Heat a small pot with water over high heat. Once it boils, add in the noodles and cook according to package instructions until chewy or to your liking. Drain from the water and place the noodles in a bowl.
2. In the same pot of water, blanch the vegetables until tender and cooked to your liking. Place in the bowl as well.
3. Remove the water from the pot and then pat dry. Heat the neutral oil over high heat until it’s very hot. You can test the heat by adding a chopped scallion and if it sizzles, it’s good to go!
4. While the oil is heating, top the noodles with the chili flakes, minced garlic, soy sauce, vinegar, chopped green onion or scallion, salt, and pepper.
5. Carefully pour in the very hot oil over the noodles. Enjoy that sizzle! Afterwards, mix everything well to coat the noodles in the flavourful oil and sauce.
6. Top with some chili garlic sauce, more chopped green onion or scallion, chili bean paste, and more soy sauce/chinkiang vinegar, to taste, if needed. Enjoy!
