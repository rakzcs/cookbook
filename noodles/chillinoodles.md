## INGREDIENTS
- 2 green onions
- 10-15 garlic cloves
- 1/2 tsp (2g) ginger
- 2 baby bok choy
- 200g Taiwanese knife-sliced noodles (or udon, spaghetti, rice noodles, etc.)
- 3 tbsp neutral-tasting oil
- 200g ground pork (or chicken, beef, tofu)
- Black pepper, to taste
- Generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds

### Sauce:
- 2-3 tbsp Korean chili pepper flakes (gochugaru)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp shaoxing wine (or mirin) (optional)

### Condiments (optional):
- Spicy chili crisp
- Chinese black vinegar

## DIRECTIONS
1. Prep Vegetables:
   - Thinly slice the green onions. Separate the white part and the green part.
   - Smash the garlic cloves and finely chop them.
   - Grate a small knob of ginger if you are using ground pork.
   - Trim off the end of the bok choy. Cut in half or quarters lengthwise.

2. Make Sauce:
   - In a small container, mix together Korean chili pepper flakes, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and shaoxing wine (if using).

3. Make Chili Garlic Noodles:
   - Prepare the bok choy and noodles. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, blanch the bok choy for about 1 minute, until slightly softened. Remove from the pot and set aside. Cook the noodles in the same water according to the package instructions.
   - Meanwhile, in a wok (or pan), add the oil (3 tbsp) and heat it over medium-high heat. Once heated, add the white part of the green onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until they get a little bit of color.
   - Add the ground pork and black pepper to taste. Break up the pork and saut√© for 1 to 2 minutes or until no longer pink. Reduce the heat to medium (or low). Add in the sauce and keep stirring it for 1 to 2 minutes.
   - Add the drained noodles. Toss until completely coated. Divide the noodles onto serving plates. Garnish with the bok choy, green onions, and sesame seeds. Enjoy!
