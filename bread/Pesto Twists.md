**Recipe Reference**: [Samsung Food Recipe](https://app.samsungfood.com/recipes/1070188b1f163137effacc0bd04ada96509)

## Ingredients

- 1 sheet puff pastry
- 2 tablespoons basil pesto
- 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato pesto
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon milk
- Sesame seeds for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 200Â°C (fan-assisted).

2. **Prepare Puff Pastry**: Unfold the puff pastry sheet and divide it into 4 equal parts.

3. **Layer with Basil Pesto**: Place one part on a clean working surface and spread 1 tablespoon of basil pesto evenly over it.

4. **Add Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto**: Cover the basil pesto layer with the second puff pastry part and spread 1 tablespoon of sun-dried tomato pesto evenly over it.

5. **Repeat Layering**: Repeat the process by adding another layer of puff pastry and spreading 1 tablespoon of basil pesto on top.

6. **Final Layer**: Finally, cover the last layer with the remaining puff pastry part. Divide this layered pastry into 8-9 equal strips, each about 2cm wide.

7. **Twist Strips**: Take one strip, give it a gentle stretch, and twist it 2-3 times. Place the twisted strip onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Repeat this step with the remaining strips.

8. **Prepare Egg Wash**: In a small bowl, combine the egg yolk and milk, mixing them well. Use a pastry brush to apply the egg wash over the pesto twists. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top for added garnish.

9. **Bake**: Bake the twists in the preheated oven for approximately 15 minutes or until they turn golden and crispy.

10. **Serve**: Once baked, serve the Pesto Twists with additional pesto or your favorite sauce.
