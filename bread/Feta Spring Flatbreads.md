## Ingredients

- 200g self-raising flour
- 130g Greek yogurt
- 100g feta cheese, crushed
- 2 tablespoons cream cheese
- Handful of mint leaves, finely chopped
- 100g spinach, wilted with boiling water, squeezed, and roughly chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 tablespoon mint sauce
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough**: In a large bowl, combine the self-raising flour and Greek yogurt. Mix with chopsticks or your hands, then knead for 5 minutes until you have a bouncy, soft dough. Add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Cover with cling film and set aside while you make your filling.

2. **Make the Filling**: Place all of your filling ingredients into a bowl and combine thoroughly. Make sure all the water is strained out of the spinach before adding it to your mixture. Set aside.

3. **Divide the Dough**: Once your dough has rested, knead it again for 30 seconds and then slice it into 4 equal-sized pieces.

4. **Assemble the Flatbreads**: Take one dough ball and lightly flatten it with your fingers until it's around 3/4 inch thick. Place a large tablespoon of the filling into the center of the dough and then bring in all the corners of the dough into the center, around the feta mixture, and seal the parcel. Turn the parcel over face down and flatten out the dough with your fingers until the flatbread is around 1/2 inch thick. Set aside with a sprinkle of flour and repeat for the other flatbreads.

5. **Cook the Flatbreads**: Place a non-stick dry pan on medium to high heat. Gently place your flatbreads into the pan and fry for 3-5 minutes on each side. Keep an eye on them and flip them over when they turn golden-brown.

6. **Prepare the Mint Sauce**: Meanwhile, combine your mint sauce and olive oil in a small bowl ready to serve.

7. **Serve**: Serve the flatbreads while they're warm or once they've cooled down with your mint sauce. Enjoy!
