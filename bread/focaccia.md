## Ingredients

- 500g white bread flour (12% protein content or higher)
- 420ml water (slightly warm)
- 4g (1 teaspoon) instant yeast
- 5g (1 teaspoon) honey (sub maple syrup or granulated sugar for vegan)
- 15ml (1 Tablespoon) extra virgin olive oil
- 10g (2 teaspoons) fine sea salt
- Extra virgin olive oil (for drizzling)
- Flaky sea salt (to finish)
- Toppings: olives, rosemary, peppers, cherry tomatoes, herbs, cheese, jalapenos, onions, pesto, chimichurri

## Steps

### Day One - Dough Mixing Day

1. **Mixing the Dough:** In a large mixing bowl, stir together the slightly warm water, instant yeast, honey, extra virgin olive oil, and fine sea salt until evenly combined. Add bread flour and mix until all dry flour patches have disappeared. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes at room temperature.

2. **Stretch + Fold:** Perform a stretch + fold to develop the gluten. Wet your hand, grab a handful of dough, and stretch it over to the opposite side. Repeat around the dough. Let rest for 10 minutes and repeat once more.

3. **Resting the Dough:** After the second set of stretch and folds, place the dough seam side down in the bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and cover. Let it rise in the fridge for 12 - 48 hours.

### Day Two - Baking Day

4. **Preparing the Tray:** Oil a 9” x 13” baking tray, line with parchment paper, and spread 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil on it.

5. **Shaping the Dough:** Gently release the dough from the bowl and place it in the tray. Fold the dough like a letter and flip it so the smooth side is up. Cover and let sit for 1.5 - 2.5 hours.

6. **Dimpling and Topping:** Preheat oven to 220C/430F. Drizzle olive oil on the dough and dimple it gently. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt and add toppings.

7. **Baking:** Bake for 18-22 minutes at 220C/430F on the lowest rack. Let it cool for a few minutes in the pan, then transfer to a cooling rack.

8. **Serving:** Optionally, top with more olive oil. Let cool for at least 15-20 minutes before cutting.

### Notes on Freezing Focaccia

- Best enjoyed fresh, but can be stored in foil and reheated in the oven.
- Can be frozen and reheated at 200C/395F for about 15 minutes.

### Notes on Flour, Equipment, and Yeast

- **Flour:** Use high-protein white bread flour. Adjust water if using all-purpose flour.
- **Equipment:** A digital kitchen scale, large mixing bowl, baking tray, and dough scraper are recommended.
- **Yeast:** Instant yeast is preferred. If using dry active yeast, allow it to bloom with warm water and honey before use.
