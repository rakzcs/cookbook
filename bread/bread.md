# Sai (Estonian Bread)

A traditional Estonian bread recipe, perfect for those who love homemade bread.

## Ingredients

- 5 dl warm water
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 packet dry yeast
- 1/2 tbsp salt
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- Approximately 800-1000g all-purpose flour (the final amount will be determined during the process)

### Optional Additions

- Ground cardamom
- 45 minutes soaked and drained raisins
- Butter
- Sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and herbs
- Seeds for sprinkling on the bread

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Dough:** Mix warm water, oil, and sugar in a large bowl.
2. **Adding Flour and Yeast:** Add 400g of flour with dry yeast mixed in. Stir until smooth. Gradually add another 6 dl of flour mixed with salt.
3. **Knead:** Knead the dough thoroughly until it barely sticks to the bowl but is still slightly sticky and manageable. The right consistency ensures the bread won't be dry.
4. **First Proofing:** Dust the dough with flour, cover the bowl with a clean towel, and place it in a warm oven (about 35-40C) to rise faster than at room temperature.
5. **Shape the Bread:** Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, divide it into two, and roll each into an A4-sized rectangle. Make light diagonal cuts on the surface.
6. **Second Proofing:** Cover the bread with a clean kitchen towel and let it rise at room temperature for 10-15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 190C with convection setting. Before baking, brush the bread with egg for a golden crust and sprinkle with your choice of seeds.
7. **Baking:** Place the bread in the middle of the oven. Add a handful of ice cubes (or water if no ice is available) at the bottom of the oven to create steam for a crispy crust.
8. **Finish Baking:** Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the bread is golden and cooked through.
