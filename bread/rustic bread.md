# Homemade Rustic Bread

A simple and delicious rustic bread recipe, perfect for beginners.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups (280g) flour, plus extra for kneading
- 1 cup (8oz) milk (whole milk recommended)
  - *Substitute: 1 cup water plus 2 tablespoons of oil or butter*
- 2 teaspoons (10 ml) baking powder
- 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt
- Olive oil or butter (for brushing)
- Additional salt (for topping, optional)

## Instructions

1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a mixing bowl.
2. **Add Milk:** Pour in the milk and use a wooden spoon to mix until just combined.
3. **Knead the Dough:** Transfer to a floured surface. Knead by folding in half, sprinkling flour, turning, and folding again, for 8-10 times until the dough is not sticky.
4. **Shape and Score:** Form the dough into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Score the top with an X pattern, not cutting all the way through.
5. **Prepare for Baking:** Brush the top with olive oil or butter and sprinkle with extra salt if desired.
6. **Bake:** Place in a preheated oven at 375F (191C) and bake for 35 minutes. The bread is done when the bottom sounds hollow when tapped.

**Note:** The bread will not brown unless brushed with oil.
