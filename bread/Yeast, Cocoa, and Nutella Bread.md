## Recipe for 2 Loaves

### Dough Ingredients
- 500g flour
- 100g sugar (half a cup)
- 25g fresh yeast or 8g dry yeast (1 tablespoon)
- 1 large egg
- 100ml sour cream
- 160g milk (3/4 cup)
- 100g butter
- 7g salt (2/3 tablespoon)

### Cocoa Filling
- 100g dark chocolate
- 100g butter
- 3/4 cup cocoa powder
- 3/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1/4 cup oil

### Nutella Layer
- 350g Nutella

### Sugar Syrup
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 cup water

### Preparation

#### Dough
1. In a mixer bowl with a dough hook, combine milk, sour cream, sugar, egg, yeast, and flour.
2. Mix on low speed for about 5 minutes. Gradually add salt and butter, continue to knead for another 2 minutes.
3. Increase to medium speed and knead for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and uniform.
4. Cover the dough and let it rise until it doubles in size (about an hour).

#### Cocoa Filling
1. In a bowl, place butter and dark chocolate. Melt in the microwave using pulses.
2. Add powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and oil. Stir well to combine.

#### Sugar Syrup
1. Prepare sugar syrup by boiling water and sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cool and store in the refrigerator.

#### Assembly
1. After the dough has risen, divide it into two parts.
2. Roll out each piece on a floured surface into a thin rectangle.
3. Spread half of the cocoa filling on one rectangle and fold it in half. Seal the edges and roll again to the same size.
4. Spread Nutella over the entire dough (slightly warm the Nutella for easier spreading).
5. Fold the dough into three parts (as shown in the video).
6. Roll out again, and using a pizza cutter, cut into 4cm wide strips. Each strip should have 4 cuts at the end, keeping one end intact.
7. Twist and roll the strips to form a knotted bread shape.
8. Place the shaped dough in the baking tray, one next to the other, and cover to rise for 35 minutes.
9. Preheat the oven to 170Â°C with fan and bake for about 45 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and cooked on all sides.
10. Remove from the oven, and while still hot, brush with sugar syrup.
11. Allow to cool before serving. Enjoy!
