## Ingredients:
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives
- 1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel or coarse kosher salt plus more for sprinkling
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 cup fresh ricotta cheese
- 4 1/3- to 1/2-inch-thick slices whole grain bread or 8 whole grain baguette slices, lightly toasted and buttered
- Whole chives (optional)

## Instructions:

### Step 1:
1. Whisk eggs, chopped chives, and 1/4 teaspoon fleur de sel in a medium bowl until well blended.
2. Melt butter in a heavy medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. When foam subsides, add eggs and stir with a heatproof silicone spatula until eggs are almost cooked but still runny in parts, tilting the skillet and stirring with spatula to allow the uncooked portion to flow underneath, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Add ricotta and stir just until incorporated but clumps of cheese are still visible.

### Step 2:
1. Arrange 2 toasts or 4 baguette slices on each of 2 plates.
2. Spoon scrambled eggs atop toasts.
3. Sprinkle with more fleur de sel and pepper.
4. Garnish with whole chives, if desired.
