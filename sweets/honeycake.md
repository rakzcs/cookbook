## Ingredients for the Base
- 8-layer cake, approximately 10-12 pieces
- 170 g honey
- 100 g sugar
- 120 g butter
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 3 large eggs
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1–2 tsp vanilla sugar
- 460 g flour
- optional: 1 tsp cinnamon
- 50 ml milk for soaking

## Ingredients for the Cream
- 900 ml whipped cream
- 200 g unsalted cream cheese
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar (optional)
- 4–5 tbsp sugar (can be replaced with honey)

## Instructions
1. In a thick-bottomed pot, combine butter, sugar, and honey. Bring to a boil and cook for a minute or two, then reduce the heat.
2. Stir in 1 tsp baking soda and continue stirring to cool down the honey mixture (as you stir, the color of the honey mixture will change and become progressively darker, which is normal). Stir until the mixture stops foaming.
3. Beat the eggs and mix them into the cooled honey mixture until the color becomes even darker.
4. In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, vanilla, and cinnamon (if using). Then, mix the flour into the honey and egg mixture in three parts until the batter is thick and slightly sticky.
5. If the dough is too runny, you can add a little more flour.
6. Mix the dough gently (do not knead).
7. Place the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes, as it will be easier to roll out afterward.
8. Divide the dough into eight equal portions and roll each one out separately. Bake each layer for about 5 minutes in a preheated oven at 170°C.
9. Note: Make sure the dough is golden brown and soft, not crispy!
10. To make the cream, mix the cream cheese with sugar or honey. Add vanilla if desired.
11. Whip the whipped cream until it reaches medium thickness.
12. Gradually fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese. This will ensure a smooth consistency rather than a lumpy one.
13. Note: Do not use a mixer to combine the creams, as it will make the mixture thicker and won't moisten the cake layers properly.
14. Allow the cake layers to cool, then place them on a base. Soak each layer with milk and place 1/8 of the cream in the center of each layer.
15. Add another layer, press down gently until the cream spreads evenly to the edges, and repeat until the final layer is complete.
16. Refrigerate the cake for at least 8 hours, preferably overnight.
