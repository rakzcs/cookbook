# Basque Burnt Cheesecake

## Ingredients:
- Cream cheese: 420g
- Heavy cream: 200g
- 3 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- Sugar: 105g
- Lemon juice: 10g

## Tin size: 21cm*9cm*6cm

**Note: All ingredients should be kept at room temperature.**
**Bake at 220°C for 20-25 minutes.**

1. Line a tin with baking paper. Preheat the oven to 230°C.
2. Press down the cream cheese with a spatula and make it soft.
3. Add sugar and combine together until the sugar granules disappear.
4. Crack eggs and egg yolks in another bowl and whisk well. Slowly and gradually add the beaten egg in 3 separate times. Do not add the egg until the batter is smooth and with no lumps.
5. Add lemon juice and mix until it’s all combined. The texture should be like mayonnaise.
6. Add heavy cream and mix until it’s all combined.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan in one go (avoid stop-and-go).
8. Tap the pan on the countertop a few times.
9. Bake at 220°C for 20-25 minutes.
(If you want a dark burnt surface, bake at 230°C.)
10. Let the cheesecake cool in the pan on a wire rack until it reaches room temperature. Then chill it in the refrigerator for over 12 hours.
11. Remove the cheesecake from the cake pan and carefully peel back the parchment paper. Cover the side of the pan with a warm wet towel to make it easier to remove the cake. You can easily cut the cake using a heated knife.
