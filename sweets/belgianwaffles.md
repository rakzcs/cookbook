# Belgian Waffles

**Quantity:** 4 large waffles

- 1 egg
- 2 dl flour
- 1 dl sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1.5 dl milk
- 100 g melted butter
- 1 tsp vanilla sugar

**For serving:** strawberries, ice cream, condensed milk, chocolate shavings, or other preferred toppings!

1. Separate the egg yolk from the egg white.
2. Mix the dry ingredients together. Add the egg yolk, milk, and melted butter while stirring.
3. Beat the egg white with a mixer until stiff peaks form. Carefully fold the beaten egg white into the batter. Let the batter thicken in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes.
4. Heat the waffle iron. Grease the waffle plates with a little oil and butter, then spread a thin layer of batter onto each plate (divide the batter into four portions). Cook for a few minutes. Repeat with the remaining waffle batter. Serve with your favorite toppings.
