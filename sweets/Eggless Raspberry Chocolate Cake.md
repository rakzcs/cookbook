## Ingredients

### For the Cake:

- 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1 cup water
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp white vinegar
- 1/2 cup fresh raspberries

### For the Raspberry Compote:
- 1 cup fresh raspberries
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup water

### For the Chocolate Ganache:
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

### For the Raspberry Compote:

1. In a saucepan, combine 1 cup fresh raspberries, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and 1/4 cup water.
2. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the raspberries break down and the mixture thickens (about 10-15 minutes).
3. Remove from heat and let it cool.

### For the Cake:

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour an 8-inch round cake pan.
2. In a mixing bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. In another bowl, whisk together the granulated sugar, vegetable oil, water, vanilla extract, and white vinegar.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until well combined.
5. Gently fold in 1/2 cup of fresh raspberries into the cake batter.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan.
7. Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
8. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for a few minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely.

### For the Chocolate Ganache:

1. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream until it begins to simmer.
2. Remove from heat and add the semisweet chocolate chips. Let it sit for a minute, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted and the ganache is smooth.

### Assembly:

1. Once the cake has cooled, spread the raspberry compote evenly on top of the cake.
2. Pour the chocolate ganache over the raspberry compote, allowing it to drip down the sides of the cake.
3. Optionally, decorate the cake with fresh raspberries.
4. Slice and serve.
