- Salt and pepper to taste

## For Serving:

## Instructions

1. **Marinade**: In a bowl, mix together dried oregano, dried thyme, dried rosemary, smoked paprika, ground cumin, ground black pepper, salt, chili flakes, white wine vinegar, honey, olive oil, finely chopped red onion, minced garlic cloves, and lemon juice. Combine the marinade with the pork meat, ensuring it's well coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, ideally overnight.

2. **Prepare Skewer**: Stack the marinated meat onto a homemade vertical skewer made of wood skewers and slices of onion/potatoes.

3. **Cook**: Preheat the oven to 175°C (347°F). Cook the meat for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. Turn the pan a couple of times during cooking to ensure even cooking. Cover with aluminum foil if the meat gets too much color.

4. **Make Tzatziki**: Grate the cucumber and squeeze out as much water as possible. Mix it with Greek yogurt, olive oil, minced garlic clove, white wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and chopped parsley on top.

5. **Slice Meat**: When the meat is done, let it rest for a couple of minutes. Use a knife to "shave" off the meat. Cover the meat with aluminum foil to keep it warm for serving.

6. **Serve**: Fill the pita bread with tzatziki, gyros meat, slices of tomato, cucumber, red onion, and fries.
