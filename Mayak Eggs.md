# Mayak Eggs

## Ingredients

- 6 eggs
- 120 ml soy sauce
- 120 ml water
- 60 ml honey or agave
- 30 ml mirin
- 1 tsp (5 ml) minced garlic
- 1-2 Serrano chilies, thinly sliced
- 15 ml Korean pepper powder
- 30 ml chopped green onions
- 15 ml sesame oil
- 15 ml sesame seeds

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Sauce**: In a bowl, combine soy sauce, water, honey or agave, mirin, minced garlic, sliced Serrano chilies, Korean pepper powder, chopped green onions, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.
2. **Boil Eggs**: Boil the eggs to your preferred level of doneness, then peel them.
3. **Marinate Eggs**: Place the peeled eggs into the sauce mixture. Stir gently to ensure they are well coated.
4. **Refrigerate**: Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. For better marination, you can place a piece of cling wrap on the eggs to submerge them completely. Alternatively, mix them once while they are refrigerating.
5. **Serve**: Serve the eggs after they have been adequately marinated.

## Notes

- Adjust the amount of Serrano chilies and Korean pepper powder based on your spice preference.
- The longer the eggs marinate, the more flavor they will absorb.
