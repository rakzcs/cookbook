## Instructions

1. Start by boiling a pot of salted water for the pasta.
2. In a large skillet, add a touch of olive oil and the butter. Once the butter melts, add in the minced garlic, shallots, and red pepper flakes. Cook until fragrant.
3. Add the shrimp to the skillet, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook until the shrimp are done, then set them aside.

5. Once the sauce has thickened, reduce the heat to low and stir in the Parmesan cheese.
6. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce, along with a ladle of the pasta water. Adjust the consistency as needed.
7. Finish by adding more cheese if desired and garnish with chopped parsley.
