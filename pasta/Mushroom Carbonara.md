**Ingredients:**
- Kosher salt
- 1½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms
- 6 garlic cloves
- 2 medium shallots
- 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems (about ½ bunch)
- 5 large egg yolks
- 1 large egg
- 4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan, plus more for serving
- 1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more
- ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 lb. orecchiette

**Instructions:**
1. Fill a large pot with water and season well with a few big pinches of salt. Bring to a boil.
2. Prepare the vegetables: Tear off and discard stems of 1½ lb. crimini or button mushrooms, then tear them into quarters (or halves if small). Thinly slice 6 garlic cloves. Finely chop 2 medium shallots. Coarsely chop 1 cup parsley leaves with tender stems.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together 5 large egg yolks, 1 large whole egg, 4 oz. store-bought pre-grated Parmesan (about 1¼ cups), and 1½ tsp. freshly ground black pepper. Set aside.
4. Heat a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes. Toss mushrooms and ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil in the pan to coat. Cook, tossing occasionally, until mushrooms are mostly golden brown, 13–16 minutes.
5. Add the orecchiette pasta to boiling salted water and set a timer 2 minutes shy of al dente according to package directions.
6. Reduce heat to medium-low and add garlic, shallots, and 1½ tsp. salt to the mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until aromatics are softened but not browned, 30–60 seconds.
7. When the pasta is 2 minutes shy of al dente, scoop out 2 cups pasta cooking liquid, then drain the pasta.
8. Add the pasta along with 1 cup pasta cooking liquid to the mushroom mixture. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring often to finish cooking the pasta and absorb the liquid, about 2 minutes.
9. Remove from heat and let cool for 1 minute. Add ½ cup pasta cooking liquid to the reserved egg mixture and whisk to combine and loosen eggs.
10. Gradually add the egg mixture to the pot, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed to create a creamy sauce that coats the noodles.
11. Add chopped parsley and stir again to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning for salt.
12. Divide the pasta among bowls. Top with additional Parmesan and a few cranks of freshly ground black pepper.
