# Caramelized Onion and Sun-Dried Tomato Pasta

## Ingredients

- 15 ml olive oil, or water
- 2 yellow onions, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 6 sun-dried tomatoes, chopped
- Â½ tsp (2.5 ml) salt
- 15 ml fresh thyme
- 120 ml dry white wine
- 235 ml pasta water
- 340 g farfalle pasta
- 120 ml cashew cream, or vegan cream
- 1 handful spinach
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Onions**: In a non-stick pan, heat the olive oil. Add the sliced onions, minced garlic, and salt. Cook over medium to low heat for approximately 25 minutes, stirring occasionally until the onions are caramelized.
2. **Cook the Pasta**: In a separate pot, cook the farfalle pasta according to the package directions. Be sure to reserve at least 235 ml of the pasta water.
3. **Create the Sauce**: To the caramelized onions, add fresh thyme, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, and white wine to deglaze the pan. Then pour in the reserved pasta water and cashew cream. Stir until a creamy sauce is formed.
4. **Combine and Serve**: Add the cooked pasta to the pan with the sauce. Mix in a handful of spinach. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- If available, use the oil from the sun-dried tomato jar for extra flavor.
- Adjust the amount of pasta water and cashew cream to achieve your desired sauce consistency.
- Spinach can be replaced with basil for a different flavor profile.
