**Ingredients:**
- 250g long pasta (angel hair, spaghetti, linguine, bucatini, etc.)
- 70ml olive oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 8 fat cloves of garlic, finely chopped
- 3 tbsp capers, rinsed and roughly chopped
- 3 anchovy fillets, rinsed
- 1 tsp crushed red pepper
- Dry vermouth or white wine
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 2 tbsp parsley, minced
- 140g freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano (you can substitute with Grana Padano, Romano, or any aged hard cheese)
- Salt and black pepper, to taste

**Instructions:**

1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water.
2. Heat the olive oil and butter in a saut√© pan over medium heat. When the butter has melted and the bubbling subsides, add the garlic and anchovies. Cook for about 2 minutes, until the anchovies dissolve into the mixture. Watch the heat to avoid burning the garlic.
3. Add the capers and crushed red pepper and cook for an additional minute or two.
4. Add a splash of dry vermouth or white wine to deglaze the pan. Cook for 2 minutes.
5. Taste and season the sauce with salt and black pepper as needed.
6. Toss the cooked pasta with the sauce, then squeeze the juice of half a lemon over it.
7. Top the pasta with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano and minced parsley.
8. Serve and enjoy!

Note: Feel free to adjust the seasoning and add more lemon or Parmigiano-Reggiano according to your taste.
