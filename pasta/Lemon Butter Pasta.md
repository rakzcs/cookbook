Source: [Reddit Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodPorn/comments/vqhhvg/oc_homemade_lemon_butter_pasta_with_pecorino/)

**Ingredients:**
- ~150g good dry Italian spaghetti
- ~50g (4 tbsp) unsalted butter
- Juice of one lemon
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of white pepper
- Lemon rind for garnish
- Pecorino Romano for garnish
- Homemade salty garlic basil butter croutons for garnish

**Instructions:**
1. Cook the pasta to your liking in salted water.
2. Melt the butter in a pan until it bubbles.
3. Add the cooked pasta to the pan and mix it with the butter until well coated.
4. Add the lemon juice followed by a ladle of starchy pasta water.
5. Emulsify the sauce to your liking. For better results, emulsify the sauce off the heat by briefly putting the pan on the heat for a few seconds.
6. Plate the pasta and garnish with pecorino romano, lemon rind, and croutons.
7. If you're adding more pasta water to make the pasta saucier, repeat the emulsification process as described in step 5.

**Tip:**
When emulsifying any sauce, avoid using high heat. High heat can break sauces without a roux or cornstarch slurry. Emulsify the sauce off the heat for better results.
