## Ingredients
- 25 ml extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 (400 g) cans crushed tomatoes
- Salt, to taste
- 500 g package potato gnocchi
- 30 ml grated Parmesan cheese
- 110 g ball fresh mozzarella, cubed
- 4 fresh basil leaves

## Directions
1. Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat; cook onion until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes and salt; simmer over low heat while you prepare the gnocchi.
2. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook gnocchi in the boiling water until they float to the top, 2 to 4 minutes. Drain.
3. Set an oven rack about 15 cm from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
4. Pour 1 ladle of tomato sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Add gnocchi, remaining tomato sauce, and Parmesan cheese; toss to combine. Arrange cubes of mozzarella cheese evenly on top.
5. Place baking dish in the oven and broil until mozzarella cheese is melted and sauce has slightly reduced, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and garnish with basil leaves before serving.
