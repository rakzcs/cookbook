**Ingredients:**
- 300 g Spaghetti
- 2 medium shallots, finely minced
- 3 medium white mushrooms, finely chopped
- 3 egg yolks (preferably dark yolk eggs)
- 60 g Parmesan cheese
- 2-3 tbsp. olive oil
- Salt & Pepper

**Instructions:**
1. Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling salted water. When the pasta is al dente, drain the pasta, and reserve a cupful of the cooking water.
2. In a bowl, mix together egg yolks, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper.
3. Meanwhile, cook shallots over medium-high heat with olive oil for 1 minute.
4. Then add the mushrooms, salt, and pepper. Gently stir, then allow the mushrooms to cook for a few minutes without disturbing them. Once browned, lower the heat a bit.
5. Add the cooked pasta and a bit of pasta water (donâ€™t use all of it) to the pan. Then add the yolks-parmesan mixture.
6. Mix everything together over low heat for about 2-3 minutes. If you need more sauce, you can add more pasta water and toss until you get a smooth and creamy texture.
7. Add additional Parmesan cheese if desired, and then serve.
