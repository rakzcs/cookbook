**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup (120g) flour + more as needed
- 2 eggs
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- 2 pints (8 oz, 225g) mushrooms
- Cream (about 1 cup, 236mL)
- Barrel-aged liquor for deglazing (optional — whiskey, brandy, bourbon, etc)
- Fresh herb for garnish (or a handful of arugula)
- Olive oil
- Salt

**Instructions:**
1. In a large mixing bowl, create a well in the center of the flour. Crack the eggs into the well and add a pinch of salt. Use a fork to beat the eggs and gradually incorporate the flour until a dough forms. Knead the dough with your hands, adding additional flour as needed, until it's smooth and elastic. Cover the dough and let it rest for at least 15 minutes.
2. While the dough rests, peel and chop the garlic, and slice the mushrooms. Start boiling water for the pasta and heat a wide pan over medium heat for the mushrooms. Add olive oil to the pan and sauté the mushrooms, stirring occasionally until they release water. Reduce stirring as they cook and set them aside when done.
3. On a floured surface, roll out the dough as thin as possible, flipping and rotating it to ensure even thickness. Flour as needed to prevent sticking. Fold the dough over itself a few times, then cut it into noodles on a cutting board. Toss the noodles in flour to prevent sticking.
4. In the same pan used for mushrooms, cook the chopped garlic for about a minute. Deglaze the pan with a splash of barrel-aged liquor or water. Pour in enough cream to cover the ingredients. Season with a pinch of salt, then simmer and stir the sauce.
5. Cook the fresh pasta in boiling water for about 2 minutes until slightly swollen and buoyant. Drain, reserving a bit of cooking water, and add both pasta and reserved water to the sauce. Toss to combine and cook until the sauce reaches the desired thickness. It will thicken as it cools. Adjust salt to taste.
6. Just before serving, stir in fresh herbs or arugula.
7. Serve the creamy mushroom pasta immediately and enjoy!

**Note:** The optional barrel-aged liquor adds depth of flavor but can be omitted if preferred.
