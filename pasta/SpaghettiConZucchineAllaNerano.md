## Ingredients (2 large servings)
- 8oz bucatini
- 3 zucchinis, sliced
- 1/3 cup olive oil (enough to have a thin layer covering the bottom of frying pan)
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 cup parsley
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 30 turns of cracked black pepper
- 1/3 cup pecorino Romano
- Salt
- Basil leaves

## How to Make It
1. Slice and salt the zucchinis and let sit for 25 minutes to allow moisture to draw out. Then rinse and pat dry.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil for the noodles.
3. To a large shallow pan, pour in the olive oil and heat it on medium. Add in the sliced zucchinis, let them brown for about 4-6 minutes, then stir and flip them over to brown on the other side.
4. Once both sides of the zucchinis are browned, season with cracked black pepper and squeeze over the juice of half a lemon.
5. Cook the bucatini pasta according to the package instructions. Drain the pasta, reserving a ladle of pasta water.
6. Add the cooked bucatini noodles to the pan with the browned zucchinis. Add a ladle of pasta water and toss to combine.
7. Stir in 1 tablespoon of butter, 1/3 cup of grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a few more turns of cracked black pepper. Add in the chopped parsley.
8. Plate the dish with fresh torn basil leaves and extra grated Pecorino Romano on top.
