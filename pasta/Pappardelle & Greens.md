# Pappardelle & Greens

A simple yet delightful pasta dish combining pappardelle and fresh greens.

## Ingredients

- Finely chopped greens: 75g
- Dried pappardelle or pasta of choice: 80g
- Garlic, finely sliced: 1 clove
- Butter: A generous knob
- Parmesan cheese: 20g
- Juice and zest of 1/4 lemon
- Sea salt: to taste

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, minus a minute or two for an al dente texture. Before draining, reserve a cup of pasta water.

2. In a wide pan, saut√© the greens with butter and garlic over medium heat until softened, about 3-4 minutes.

3. Add the drained pasta to the pan with the greens. Toss vigorously, adding just enough reserved pasta water to create a smooth sauce.

4. Turn off the heat. Stir in the Parmesan cheese and lemon juice. Season to taste with sea salt.

5. Serve with a sprinkle of lemon zest and extra Parmesan cheese, if desired.
