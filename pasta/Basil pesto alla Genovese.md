**Ingredients for a Single Portion:**
- 1 garlic clove (5g), peeled
- 1 handful (10g) pine nuts (or any other nut)
- 1 handful (10g) grated pecorino or parmesan cheese
- 1 big bunch (25g) fresh basil leaves
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of sugar (optional)
- Good olive oil
- Pasta (1/4 lb, 113g is a generous single portion)

**Instructions:**
1. Start by boiling your pasta in salted water.
2. If using a knife or a food processor, chop the garlic clove and then chop it into the nuts. Add basil leaves and cheese. Chop everything as finely as possible. Sprinkle over a pinch of coarse salt (and sugar, if using), then grind the mixture into your cutting board with the side of your knife to create a smooth paste.
3. If using a mortar & pestle, grind the garlic clove with a pinch of coarse salt (and sugar, if using) until liquified. Grind in the nuts until smooth. Chop basil and cheese before grinding them in. You can switch to a wooden spoon for the last bit of grinding.
4. Stir in enough olive oil to get a thick, saucy consistency.
5. Drain the pasta, reserving a little bit of the starchy water. Stir in the pesto and adjust the consistency with pasta water and/or more olive oil.

**Note:**
- If you want the pesto to stay green permanently, quickly blanch it in boiling water for 10 seconds, then transfer it to a bowl of ice water. Squeeze it dry and chop it finely. Proceed with boiling the pasta and following the rest of the instructions.
