## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp Capers
- 1 Bunch Parsley
- 7 Anchovies
- 1 Handful Kalamata Olives
- 800 g Plum Tomatoes
- 1 tsp Chilli Flakes
- 5 Cloves Garlic
- 500 g Spaghetti
- Olive Oil

## Instructions
### Step 1
- Add your chopped anchovies and chilli flakes into a frying pan with a tablespoon of olive oil and a tbsp of oil from the anchovy tin. Fry for one minute.

### Step 2
- Crush your garlic cloves and add them with a large handful of finely chopped parsley stalks. Mix everything together.

### Step 3
- Add your capers, olives, and pour in the plum tomatoes. Break the tomatoes up with a wooden spoon. Refill both the tins halfway with water and add to the sauce.

### Step 4
- Get your pasta boiling in a separate pot.

### Step 5
- Allow the sauce to reduce. Add a couple of tablespoons of your starchy pasta water to make it nice and glossy. Just when you are removing the pasta from the heat, season the sauce with salt and pepper and add a large handful of chopped parsley.

### Step 6
- Drain the pasta and pour it into the saucepan with the puttanesca sauce. Mix everything together and remove from the heat. Serve with some parsley leaves scattered on top and a good glug of olive oil.
