**Ingredients:**
- 3 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 1 bulb of garlic, minced
- 500ml heavy cream
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- 140g fresh shredded Parmesan cheese
- 200g shredded mozzarella cheese

**Directions:**
1. Melt butter and olive oil over medium-low heat in a saucepan.
2. Add minced garlic, heavy cream, and white pepper to the saucepan. Bring the mixture to a simmer, stirring often.
3. Stir in the shredded Parmesan cheese and continue simmering for 8-10 minutes, or until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.
4. Add the shredded mozzarella cheese and stir frequently. Be careful not to burn the sauce.
5. Turn off the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove. The sauce will continue to thicken as it sits. Taste and add garlic powder or salt if needed.
6. Note: If you end up using too much mozzarella and the sauce becomes stringy, you can use pasta water as needed to thin out the sauce.
