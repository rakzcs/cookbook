Classic Italian dish celebrating the simplicity and freshness of tomatoes.

## Ingredients

- Spaghetti: 320g
- Ripe tomatoes or cherry tomatoes: 800g
- Garlic cloves or 1 shallot: 2 cloves / 1 shallot
- Olive oil: 4 tablespoons
- Fresh basil: to taste
- Salt: to taste

## Instructions

1. Prepare the fresh tomato sauce. Wash the tomatoes, remove the stems, and cut them in half. Finely chop the garlic cloves and shallot.

2. Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the garlic and shallot, saut√©ing lightly without burning.

3. Place the tomatoes in the pan with the garlic and oil, cut side down. Add torn fresh basil leaves.

4. Season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Mix well.

5. Cook the sauce over medium-low heat for about 15-20 minutes, until the tomatoes soften and create a thick sauce. You can gently crush the tomatoes with a spoon for a creamier texture.

6. Boil a pot of salted water and cook the spaghetti as per package instructions.

7. Drain the al dente spaghetti, reserving some pasta water.

8. Add the drained spaghetti to the pan with the tomato sauce. Mix well, adding pasta water if needed to loosen the sauce.

9. Serve the spaghetti hot, garnished with generous cheese, fresh basil, and a sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper.
