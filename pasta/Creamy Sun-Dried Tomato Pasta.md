**Ingredients:**
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 yellow onion, peeled and sliced
- 70g sun-dried tomatoes in oil, roughly chopped, plus 1 teaspoon of the oil
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tsp dry Italian oregano
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, optional
- 2 cups water or vegetable stock
- 100g mascarpone or heavy cream
- 200g Tagliatelle
- 1 tsp truffle cream, optional
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**
1. Heat the oil in a wide pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring regularly, for 8-10 minutes until softened. Season with salt and pepper.
2. Add the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and 1 teaspoon tomato oil from the jar. Cook for 3-4 minutes more.
3. Melt the butter into the onions and tomatoes. Once frothy, add the oregano and crushed red pepper. Cook for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Pour in the water or stock and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and hard simmer until thickened, about 15 minutes. If the sauce reduces too quickly, reduce heat to low and add a splash or two more of water. Taste and season to your preferences.
5. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve 1/3 cup of the pasta cooking water and set it aside. Drain the pasta.
6. If using truffle cream, add it to the reserved hot pasta cooking water and stir to temper it.
7. Add the mascarpone or heavy cream to the pot of sun-dried tomato sauce and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium and add the reserved pasta cooking water with truffle cream. Let the sauce bubble for 5 minutes until thickened. Taste and season.
8. Add the cooked pasta to the sauce and cook for 1-2 minutes more until fully coated. Turn off the heat.
9. Divide the pasta into shallow bowls. Garnish with parsley. Enjoy your creamy sun-dried tomato pasta!

**Note:** The truffle cream is optional and can be omitted if preferred.
