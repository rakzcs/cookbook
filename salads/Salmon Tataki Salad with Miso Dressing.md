## Ingredients

### For the Miso Dressing
- 15 ml miso paste (white)
- 22.5 ml rice vinegar
- 5 ml tamari (low sodium)
- 10 ml honey
- 80 ml extra virgin olive oil
- 7.5 ml sesame oil (toasted)

### For the Salad
- 225 g sushi-grade salmon (skin removed)
- 15 ml black sesame seeds
- 15 ml white sesame seeds
- 1.2 liters mixed greens (arugula, mizuna mix)
- 1/4 watermelon radish, thinly sliced into matchsticks
- 120 ml peas (fresh young peas)
- 1/2 jalapeño, sliced thin (or serrano)
- 1/4 red onion, sliced thin
- 1/2 avocado, cubed
- 240 ml cilantro, roughly torn (tough stems removed)

## Instructions

### For the Dressing
1. In a bowl, combine miso, rice vinegar, tamari, and honey. Whisk well.
2. Slowly drizzle in both oils while whisking continuously, until smooth. Set aside.

### For the Salad
1. Lightly drizzle avocado oil over salmon and season lightly with kosher salt.
2. Mix black and white sesame seeds in a shallow bowl. Press salmon into seeds to coat all sides.
3. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Drizzle a small amount of avocado oil.
4. Sear salmon for 20 to 25 seconds per side. Remove, set aside on a plate, and cool in fridge for 15 to 30 minutes.
5. Once cooled, slice salmon into slabs.
6. In a large salad bowl, combine greens, radish, peas, jalapeño, and red onion. Add about half of the dressing and toss.
7. Add avocado and cilantro, gently toss. Divide salad onto plates, top with salmon, and drizzle remaining dressing as needed.
