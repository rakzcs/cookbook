# Tangy Cucumber Salad

## Ingredients:
- 2 hot house or seedless cucumbers, about 1 1/2 pounds
- Salt
- 2 to 3 teaspoons granulated sugar, depending on how sweet you like the salad
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) cider vinegar or distilled white vinegar
- 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
- 1/4 of a medium red onion, thinly sliced

## Instructions:

1. Peel and slice the cucumbers: Peel the cucumbers if the skin is tough or if you prefer the taste of cucumbers without the skin. Slice the cucumbers in half lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a small spoon (if the cucumbers are really young, the seeds will be tender and you can leave them in). Cut the cucumber into 1/4-inch thick slices and place them in a colander set in a bowl.

2. Salt the cucumbers: Toss the cucumbers with salt. Add 2 to 3 teaspoons of salt to the cucumbers, depending on how much salt you like, and toss to coat. Let the cucumbers sit in the colander over a bowl to catch the excess moisture for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 hours in the fridge.

3. Rinse, drain excess water: Rinse the cucumbers with cool water in the colander to remove excess salt. Drain the cucumbers of excess water.

4. Whisk sugar, vinegar, mustard, add onions: In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, vinegar, and Dijon mustard until the sugar has completely dissolved. Stir in the finely sliced red onions.

5. Combine cucumbers with dressing, chill: Gently fold the cucumbers into the dressing. Chill until ready to serve. Serve lightly chilled or at room temperature.

Enjoy your Tangy Cucumber Salad!
